Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in software that prevents it from running correctly. As you become a more advanced programmer and an industry engineer, you will learn how to use debugging tools such as gdb or built-in tools that IDEs have. However, it’s important to understand the concepts and processes of debugging manually.


### Technologies 🖥️

## Table of contents
0. [Multiple mains](./0-main.c) : Here we are debugging the `positive_or_negative()` function
1. [Like, comment, subscribe](./1-main.c) : Preventing the code from getting into an infinate loop
2. [0 > 972?](./2-largest_number.c) : Fixing the bug of the programme providing the wrong outpt. Checking for the largest number
3. [Leap year](./3-print_remaining_days.c) ; This program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration.
